## Earth B n B Project

# by TalentPath Quaran-team!

We have endeavored to re-create an online vacation rental like application.

Using Java - Spring Boot Server tied to a MySql Database for our data API. 

To run locally after cloning or forking - you will need Java 10 or higher a code editor or IDE,
Maven, Flyway, and MySql installed.

Change the username and password in the application.properties file under the resources folder if your MySql username and password differ.

____

To start the server app:

'mvn spring-boot:start'

If updates have been made to the sql seed files a migration clean should be preformed. This involves running the commands

'mvn flyway:clean'

followed by

'mvn clean'

before starting the server.
